    [Your Task for {trade_date_str}]
    Your task is to populate the JSON template below. You MUST use the following trading model to generate your analysis.

    --- START MASTERCLASS: THE 4-PARTICIPANT MODEL ---

    **Part 1: The Core Philosophy (Exhaustion & Absence)**
    This is the most important concept. Price moves are driven by the *absence* or *exhaustion* of one side, not just the *presence* of the other.
    * **Price falls because:** Committed Buyers are **absent** (they are competing for a better, lower price).
    * **Price rises because:** Committed Sellers are **absent** or **exhausted** (they have finished selling at a level).

    **Part 2: The Two Market States (Stable vs. Unstable)**
    * **1. Stable Market:** (Default) Driven by **Committed Participants**. A rational market focused on "exhaustion" at key levels.
    * **2. Unstable Market:** (Exception) Driven by **Desperate Participants**. An emotional market, a *reaction* to a catalyst (news, panic, FOMO).

    **Part 3: The Four Participant Types**
    * **Committed Buyers:** Patiently accumulate at or below support.
    * **Committed Sellers:** Patiently distribute at or above resistance.
    * **Desperate Buyers:** (FOMO / Panic) Buy *aggressively* at *any* price.
    * **Desperate Sellers:** (Panic / Capitulation) Sell *aggressively* at *any* price.

    **Part 4: The 5 Key Patterns (How to Identify the State)**
    1.  **Accumulation (Stable):** A *slow* fight at support, marked by **higher lows** as sellers become exhausted.
    2.  **Capitulation (Unstable):** A *fast* vacuum, as **Desperate Sellers** sell and **Committed Buyers step away**.
    3.  **Stable Uptrend (Stable):** Caused by **Absent/Exhausted Committed Sellers** at resistance, often followed by a "check" (retest) of the broken level.
    4.  **Washout & Reclaim (Hybrid -> Unstable):** **Committed Buyers** let support break, then turn into **Desperate Buyers** to get filled, causing a *violent reversal*.
    5.  **Chop (Stable):** Equilibrium. **Committed Buyers** defend the low, **Committed Sellers** defend the high. No one is desperate.

    **Part 5: The 3 Levels of Story Confidence (The "Conviction" Score)**
    This is your *separate* analysis of the day's *objective outcome*.
    * **High Story_Confidence:** Today's action was **decisive and confirming**. It *either* 1) strongly *confirmed* the `Trend_Bias` AND *respected* a MAJOR S/R level, *or* 2) it achieved a *decisive, high-volume CLOSE* *beyond* a MAJOR S/R level.
    * **Medium Story_Confidence:** Today's action was **mixed or indecisive**. This includes 1) closing *at* or *near* a major level, 2) a breakout/breakdown on *low, unconvincing volume*, or 3) a "Doji" or "inside day".
    * **Low Story_Confidence:** Today's action was a **failure or reversal**. It *failed* at a key level and *reversed* *against* the `Trend_Bias` (e.g., a "failed breakout" that closed back inside the range).

    --- END MASTERCLASS ---

    **YOUR EXECUTION TASK (Filling the JSON):**

    **1. Calculate `Trend_Bias`:**
        * First, determine the **lagging, multi-day `Trend_Bias`** using the rule: "Maintain the `bias` from the [Previous Card] unless [Today's Action] *decisively breaks AND closes beyond* a MAJOR level."

    **2. `confidence` (The "Story"):**
        * This is your *first* output field. You MUST combine the `Trend_Bias` (from Step 1) with the `Story_Confidence` (from Masterclass Part 5) and provide a "Proof of Reasoning."
        * **Final Format:** "Trend_Bias: [Your calculated Trend_Bias] (Story_Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]) - Reasoning: [Your justification for the H/M/L rating]."
        * **Example:** "Trend_Bias: Bearish (Story_Confidence: Low) - Reasoning: The action was a *failure* against the Bearish trend. It *failed* at $265 resistance and reversed, but the 'Accumulation' pattern means the breakdown itself has failed, matching the 'Low Confidence' definition."

    **3. `basicContext.recentCatalyst` (The "Governing Narrative"):**
        * Manage this as the **cumulative story**.
        * **Step 1:** Read the `recentCatalyst` from the `[Previous Card]`.
        * **Step 2:** *Hunt* the `[Overall Market Context for Today]` for any *company-specific* news.
        * **Step 3 (Execute):**
            * **If new info:** **Append** it to the previous narrative.
            * **If no new info:** **Carry over** the *entire, unchanged* narrative from the `[Previous Card]`.

    **4. `fundamentalContext` (Dynamic Fields):**
        * **`valuation`:** "AI RULE: READ-ONLY".
        * **`analystSentiment` & `insiderActivity`:**
            * **Step 1:** Read from `[Previous Card]`.
            * **Step 2:** *Hunt* the `[Overall Market Context for Today]` for new analyst ratings or insider transactions.
            * **Step 3 (Execute):** **Update** if new info is found, otherwise **carry over** the unchanged data.

    **5. `technicalStructure` Section (The "Macro" / Zone Analysis):**
        * **`majorSupport` / `majorResistance`:**
            * Your base is `[Historical Notes]`.
            * You MUST *evolve* these fields based on *repeated* participant action from the `[Log of Recent Key Actions]`.
            * **Rule:** If 'Committed Buyers' defend a *new* level for 2-3 days, you MUST add it as a 'New tactical support'.
            * **Rule:** If a `Historical Note` level is broken and *held* for 2-3 days, you MUST re-label it (e.g., '$265 (Old Resistance, now 'Stable Market' support)').
        * **`pattern` (The "Structural Narrative"):**
            * This is the **multi-day structural story** *relative to the zones*.
            * (e.g., "Price is in a 'Balance (Chop)' pattern, coiling between the Committed Buyer zone at $415 and the Committed Seller zone at $420.")

    **6. `technicalStructure.volumeMomentum` (The "Volume Analysis"):**
        * **This is your next analysis.** Your job is to be the volume analyst.
        * Describe ONLY how volume from `[Today's New Price Action Summary]` *confirmed or denied* the action *at the specific levels*.
        * **Example 1 (Confirmation):** "High-volume defense. The rejection of the $239.15 low was confirmed by the day's highest volume spike, proving Committed Buyers were present in force."
        * **Example 2 (No Confirmation):** "Low-volume breakout. The move above $420 resistance was on low, unconvincing volume, signaling a 'Stable Market' (Committed Seller) exhaustion, not 'Unstable' (Desperate Buyer) panic."

    **7. `behavioralSentiment` Section (The "Micro" / Today's Analysis):**
        * **`emotionalTone` (Pattern + Proof of Reasoning):**
            * This is your **Justification**, not a description. You MUST show your work by following this 3-part logic:
            * **1. Observation (The "What"):** State the objective price action from `[Today's Summary]` (e.g., "Price formed a higher-low pattern...").
            * **2. Inference (The "So What?"):** State what this action *means* according to the Masterclass philosophy. (e.g., "This action is the *opposite* of a 'price vacuum' (which would signal `Desperate Sellers`). It proves buyers who were 'absent' are now becoming more aggressive.").
            * **3. Conclusion (The "Why"):** State the *psychological event* this signals. (e.g., "Therefore, this price action is the classic signal of **seller exhaustion** and a shift to *competing* **Committed Buyers**.").
            * **Final Format:** "Label - Reasoning: [Your full 3-part proof]"
            * **Example:** "Accumulation (Stable) - Reasoning: **(1. Observation)** The `[Price Summary]` shows sellers were unable to achieve a new low with conviction, instead forming a higher-low pattern. **(2. Inference)** This action is *not* a 'price vacuum' (which would signal `Desperate Sellers`); it proves that buyers who were 'absent' are now competing more aggressively. **(3. Conclusion)** This directly signals **seller exhaustion** and a shift to competing **Committed Buyers** as defined in the Masterclass."
        * **`newsReaction` (Headwind/Tailwind):**
            * This is your *relative strength* analysis. Compare the stock's `emotionalTone` to the `[Overall Market Context]`.
            * (e.g., "Market was bearish (headwind), but the stock held its $266 support in an 'Accumulation' pattern. This shows *extreme relative strength*...")
        * **`buyerVsSeller` (The Conclusion):**
            * This is your *final synthesis* of the `emotionalTone` and `newsReaction`.
            * (e.g., "Committed Buyers are in firm control. They not only showed a 'Stable Accumulation' pattern at $415 but did so *against* a weak, bearish market, confirming their high conviction.")

    **8. `keyActionLog`:** Write your `todaysAction` log entry *last*, using the language from your `behavioralSentiment` analysis.
    **9. `openingTradePlan` & `alternativePlan`:** Update these for TOMORROW.

    **10. `screener_briefing` (The "Data Packet" for Python):**
        * This is your **final** task. You will generate the data packet *after* all other analysis is complete.
        * **Step 1: Calculate the `Setup_Bias` (Master Synthesis Rule):**
            * Your `Setup_Bias` for *this field only* MUST be a *synthesis* of your `pattern` (Macro) and `emotionalTone` (Micro) findings.
            * **Rule 1 (Change of Character):** If today's `emotionalTone` (e.g., 'Accumulation') *contradicts* the `Trend_Bias` (e.g., 'Bearish'), the **`emotionalTone` takes precedence.** The `Setup_Bias` *must* reflect this *new change* in market character.
                * *(Example: `emotionalTone: 'Accumulation'` at support MUST result in a `Setup_Bias: Neutral` or `Neutral (Bullish Lean)`.)*
            * **Rule 2 (Use Relative Strength):** Use your `newsReaction` (relative strength/weakness) to "shade" the bias.
                * *(Example: `emotionalTone: 'Accumulation'` + `newsReaction: 'Extreme Relative Strength'` = `Setup_Bias: Neutral (Bullish Lean)` or `Bullish`.)*
        * **Step 2: Summarize the `Catalyst`:**
            * Create a clean, one-line summary of the "Governing Narrative" you already built for the `recentCatalyst` field.
            * **Example:** "Post-earnings consolidation and new AI deal."
        * **Step 3: Assemble the "Data Packet":**
            * You *must* output a multi-line string in the *exact* key-value format specified below.
            * For `Plan_A_Level` and `Plan_B_Level`, extract the *primary* price level from the `trigger`.
            * For `S_Levels` and `R_Levels`, extract *all* numerical price levels from `technicalStructure.majorSupport` and `technicalStructure.majorResistance`. Format them as a comma-separated list *inside brackets*.
        * **Exact Output Format:**
        Setup_Bias: [Your *newly calculated* 'Setup Bias' from Step 1]

    **CRITICAL ANALYTICAL RULES (LEVELS ARE PARAMOUNT):**
    * **Bias:** (This rule is *only* for the `Trend_Bias` calculation in Task 1. Do not use it for the `Setup_Bias` in Task 10.) Maintain the `bias` from the [Previous Card] unless [Today's Action] *decisively breaks AND closes beyond* a MAJOR level.
    * **Plans:** Update BOTH `openingTradePlan` and `alternativePlan` for TOMORROW.
    * **Volume:** (This rule is now handled in Task 6).

    {etf_summaries or "No ETF summaries were provided."}

    [Your Task for {trade_date_str}]
    Based on *all* the information above, generate a new, complete JSON object by following
    these rules to fill the template below.

    **Master Rule (Weighted Synthesis - 60/40 Logic):**
    Your primary goal is to determine the **governing short-term trend** (the "story" from the last 3-5 days) and then evaluate if **today's action** (the new data) *confirms, contradicts, or changes* that trend.

    1.  **Identify the "Governing Trend" (The 60% Weight):**
        * First, read the `marketBias` and `indexAnalysis` from the `[Previous Day's Card]` and the `[Log of Recent Key Actions]`.
        * This gives you the established narrative. (e.g., "SPY is in a 3-day bearish channel, failing at $450.")

    2.  **Evaluate "Today's Data" (The 40% Weight):**
        * **Synthesize BOTH data sources.** Read the `[Market Wrap News]` for the narrative (e.g., "breadth was weak").
        * **Then, verify** that narrative using the `[Key ETF Summaries]` (e.g., "This is confirmed: IWM and DIA broke their ORLs and closed below VWAP, while QQQ held its VAL.").
        * The *quality* of the move (proven by levels) is more important than the direction.

    3.  **Synthesize (The New `marketBias` and `marketNarrative`):**
        * Your `marketNarrative` must explain this two-part synthesis.
        * **If Today's Data CONFIRMS the trend:** The `marketBias` is strengthened. (e.g., "A low-volume rally into resistance, confirmed by IWM closing below its POC, *confirms* the bearish trend. Bias remains `Bearish`.")
        * **If Today's Data is just NOISE:** The `marketBias` is unchanged.
        * **If Today's Data CHANGES the trend:** The `marketBias` can flip. This *must* be a high-conviction event, supported by *both* the narrative and strong level-based breaks in the ETFs (e.g., "SPY broke *above* the $450 channel on high volume, with QQQ and IWM also closing above their VAH. The governing trend is now changing. Bias moves to `Neutral` or `Bullish`.")

    **Detailed "Story-Building" Rules:**

    * **`keyEconomicEvents`:** Populate this *directly* from the "REAR VIEW" and "COMING UP" sections of the `[Market Wrap News]`.
    * **`indexAnalysis` (Story-Building):**
        * Read the `indexAnalysis` from the `[Previous Day's Card]`.
        * Using today's `[Market Wrap News]` *and* the specific levels from the `[Key ETF Summaries]`, write the **new, updated** analysis.
        * **You MUST cite level-based evidence.** (e.g., "SPY *failed at* $450 resistance, as noted in the Market Wrap, and this was **confirmed by the ETF data** showing a close below VWAP ($448.50) and the POC ($449.00).").
    * **`sectorRotation` (Story-Building):**
        * Read the `sectorRotation` analysis from the `[Previous Day's Card]`.
        * Using today's ETF data (XLK, XLF, etc.), update the `leadingSectors`, `laggingSectors`, and `rotationAnalysis`.
        * **Cite level-based evidence.** (e.g., "Tech (XLK) *was* a leading sector for 5 days but saw profit-taking today, **closing below its VAH ($303.78)**, moving it to lagging...").
    * **`interMarketAnalysis` (Story-Building):**
        * Read the `interMarketAnalysis` from the `[Previous Day's Card]`.
        * Using the `[Market Wrap News]` ("FIXED INCOME", "CRUDE", "FX" sections) *and* the `[Key ETF Summaries]` for TLT, GLD, UUP, **continue the narrative**.
        * (e.g., "Bonds (TLT) *continued* their decline, *confirming* the risk-on flow by **breaking below VAL ($89.60)**..." or "The Dollar (UUP) was choppy, **crossing VWAP ($28.23) multiple times** as the Market Wrap noted...").
    * **`todaysAction` (The Log):** Create a *new, single log entry* for today's macro action, referencing both the Market Wrap narrative and key ETF level interactions.

    **MISSING DATA RULE (CRITICAL):**
    * If `[Market Wrap News]` or `[Key ETF Summaries]` are missing, empty, or clearly irrelevant, you **MUST** state this in the relevant analytical fields.
    * **DO NOT** silently copy yesterday's data.
    * *(Example: `indexAnalysis.SPY`: "No new ETF data was provided to update the analysis.")*
